## Overview

This is a Pomodoro Timer application built using Python and Tkinter. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

This project aims to provide a simple and customizable Pomodoro Timer with a user-friendly graphical interface.
